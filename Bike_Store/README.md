# Project Description 
This project aims to address the need for comprehensive insights into the sales activity of a bike store company. As a sales analyst, you have a customer who owns a bike store and wants to gain valuable insights into the company's sales trends, revenue distribution, and top-performing elements over a specific period (2016-2018). Management's objectives include understanding the sales activity, trends, and performance on various levels, from regions and stores to product categories and brands. Additionally, they are interested in identifying the top customers and sales representatives contributing to the company's revenue.
