# Project Description.

This project combines data from a sample MongoDB database, the World Bank API, and a dataset from Kaggle. 

To receate the project, you will need to alter the following variable definitions in the Jupyter notebook named "etl_airbnb.ipynb" to connect to your MySQL server. 

host_name = "127.0.0.1"

user_id = "root" 

pwd = "mysqlpwd" 

Then run the notebook. This will create and populate a database named 'airbnb'. To test the functionality of the database, run the SQL file named "date_dim.sql". 

## Language and Programs
